       <h1>Hello, I'm Audrey </h1>
       <img src="images/profile-picture.jpg" class="img-circle" width="100px" alt="Audrey Torres">
       <p>Hi, my name is Audrey. ndisin I am a student in Master 1 of Digital Marketing & Innovation at Ieseg. At the same time, I'm doing a work-study program in the Bruneau group, a stationery and furniture company for professionals, where I work as a product/merchandising e-commerce assistant.</p>
       <p>My professional project after my studies is to join a retailer such as Carrefour as a product manager.It's a job that would make sense to me, because I would be in charge of products that are "vital" and my objective would be to promote them and make them accessible to the greatest number of people (like organic products for example).</p>

      <h1>My passions</h1>
      <h2>Reading 📖</h2>
        <p>
          I like to read, to immerse myself in another universe and to make my imagination work. Since I was 8 years old, I read novels that were hundreds of pages long.

      <h2>Gym 🏋️‍♀️</h2>
        <p>
          I also go to the gym 2 to 3 times a week. This allows me to push myself and clear my head after my day.
